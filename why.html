            <h1>Here are the main advantages of joining the Barbers Federation of Ireland</h1>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Professional credibility</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                A license signals training, skill, and safety knowledge to clients and employers.  
                Makes it easier to build a loyal client base and get referrals.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Stronger skills and safety knowledge</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                Training covers cutting, shaving, skin and hair health, hygiene, and sanitation.  
                You’re less likely to injure clients or spread infections, which protects your reputation.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>More Job Opportunities</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                Access to barbershops, salons, spas, hotels, cruise ships, and sometimes TV/film work.  
                Some brands and chains only hire licensed professionals.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Ability to specialize and grow</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                You can develop a niche: fades, beard work, hot towel shaves, textured hair, etc.  
                Easier to move into teaching, shop ownership, or brand ambassador roles later.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Higher Earning Potential</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
              Licenced and registered barbers can usually charge more or get better paying jobs.
              Shops often prefer or require licenced staff, which can mean a more stable income and tips.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Mobility</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                In many places, once you’re licensed you can transfer or get recognition in other regions with less hassle.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Client trust and loyalty</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                Clients feel safer letting a licensed pro use razors and chemicals on their skin and hair.  
                That trust turns into repeat visits and word-of-mouth marketing.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Business and entrepreneurship options</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
               Many barbers become independent contractors or shop owners.  
               With a license, it’s simpler to get insurance, permits, and sometimes small business loans.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>Community and networking</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                Barbering is very social; you build a network of clients and other barbers who can help you find work, improve your skills, or collaborate.
