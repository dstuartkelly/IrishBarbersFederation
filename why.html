                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">⭐</div>
                    <h3>Professional credibility</h3>
                    <p>A license signals training, skill, and safety knowledge to clients and employers.
                    Makes it easier to build a loyal client base and get referrals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">🛡️</div>
                    <h3>Stronger skills and safety knowledge</h3>
                    <p>Training covers cutting, shaving, skin and hair health, hygiene, and sanitation.  
                    You’re less likely to injure clients or spread infections, which protects your reputation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">💼</div>
                    <h3>More Job Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>Access to barbershops, salons, spas, hotels, cruise ships, and sometimes TV/film work.  
                    Some brands and chains only hire licensed professionals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">📈</div>
                    <h3>Ability to specialize and grow</h3>
                    <p>You can develop a niche: fades, beard work, hot towel shaves, textured hair, etc.  
                    Easier to move into teaching, shop ownership, or brand ambassador roles later.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">💰</div>
                    <h3>Higher Earning Potential</h3>
                    <p>licensed and registered barbers can usually charge more or get better paying jobs.
                    Shops often prefer or require licensed staff, which can mean a more stable income and tips.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">🌍</div>
                    <h3>Mobility</h3>
                    <p>In many places, once you’re licensed you can transfer or get recognition in other regions with less hassle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">🤝</div>
                    <h3>Client trust and loyalty</h3>
                    <p>Clients feel safer letting a licensed pro use razors and chemicals on their skin and hair.  
                    That trust turns into repeat visits and word-of-mouth marketing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">🚀</div>
                    <h3>Business and entrepreneurship options</h3>
                    <p>Many barbers become independent contractors or shop owners.  
                    With a license, it’s simpler to get insurance, permits, and sometimes small business loans.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <div class="feature-icon">👥</div>
                    <h3>Community and networking</h3>
                    <p>Barbering is very social; you build a network of clients and other barbers who can help you find work, improve your skills, or collaborate.</p>
